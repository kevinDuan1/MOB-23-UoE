    "\n",
    "\"You Only Look Once\" (YOLO) is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. This algorithm \"only looks once\" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. \n",

    "### Model Details\n",

    "#### Inputs and outputs\n",
    "- The **input** is a batch of images, and each image has the shape (m, 608, 608, 3). Notices we will be using slightly different sizes of input images. More on that later.\n",
    "- The **output** is a list of bounding boxes along with the recognized classes. Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers $(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w, c)$ as explained above. If you expand $c$ into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding box is then represented by 85 numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anchor Boxes\n",
    "* Anchor boxes are chosen by exploring the training data to choose reasonable height/width ratios that represent the different classes.  For this assignment, 5 anchor boxes were chosen for you (to cover the 80 classes), and stored in the file './model_data/yolo_anchors.txt'\n",
    "* The dimension for anchor boxes is the second to last dimension in the encoding: $(m, n_H,n_W,anchors,classes)$.\n",
